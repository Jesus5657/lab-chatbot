    "#Summary of Findings\n",
    "#I explored three customized chatbot scenarios: DessertBot, SnackBot, and BloomBot, each designed to handle specific types of orders in their respective domains. Overall, the performance of the chatbots was effective and engaging, with notable variations in the quality of responses depending on the complexity of the instructions and user inputs.\n",
    "#DessertBot:\n",
    "\n",
    "#The chatbot successfully handled dessert orders and clarified size, type, and extras (e.g., whipped cream, sprinkles).\n",
    "#It summarized the orders concisely and asked if the customer needed anything else.\n",
    "#Occasionally, it struggled with complex orders combining multiple desserts and drinks, leading to minor misinterpretations, such as leaving out an item in the summary.\n",
    "#SnackBot:\n",
    "\n",
    "#SnackBot demonstrated excellent ability to manage movie-theater-style orders. It effectively clarified options like butter for popcorn or drink sizes.\n",
    "#The chatbot performed well in summarizing multiple items but occasionally created incorrect totals if user inputs were vague (e.g., \"large popcorn with butter\" was miscalculated without clearly specifying the butter price).\n",
    "#BloomBot:\n",
    "\n",
    "#BloomBot provided warm and helpful responses, assisting users in selecting bouquets and recommending thoughtful extras like greeting cards.\n",
    "#It handled delivery details, including collecting addresses and card messages, with precision.\n",
    "#However, it sometimes overgeneralized recommendations by suggesting unavailable options not mentioned in the menu (e.g., offering orchids or sunflowers).\n",
    "#Variations That Didnâ€™t Work Well\n",
    "#Hallucination Issues: In some cases, the chatbot introduced items or options that werenâ€™t in the menu, such as additional dessert toppings or unavailable flower types. This occurred more often with BloomBot, likely because of the broader context of flowers being a creative domain.\n",
    "#Price Calculation Errors: When multiple modifications (e.g., adding butter, extra cheese, or whipped cream) were included, the chatbot occasionally miscalculated the total price by omitting or mispricing some extras.\n",
    "#Complex Orders: If a user provided a long, detailed order in a single input, the chatbot sometimes misunderstood or missed parts of the order, resulting in incomplete summaries."

    "#What I Learned\n",
    "#Importance of Clear Instructions: The performance of the chatbot was strongly influenced by the specificity of the system prompt. Detailed instructions reduced hallucinations and improved accuracy in order-taking and summarization.\n",
    "#Limitations of Context: The chatbot can remember and build on prior messages in a conversation but has a limited ability to process highly complex or vague inputs effectively.\n",
    "#Temperature Settings Matter: Lower temperature settings improved accuracy and consistency, while higher temperatures occasionally led to more creative but less reliable responses.\n",
    "#User Input Ambiguity: When user inputs were ambiguous, the chatbot often made assumptions, underscoring the importance of designing clarifying questions into the conversation flow.\n",
    "#Conclusion\n",
    "#Customized chatbots can effectively simulate specialized order-taking tasks, but their performance depends on clear instructions, well-structured menus, and robust conversation flows. Addressing hallucinations and ensuring accurate calculations are key areas for improvement. Overall, the exercise showcased the potential and challenges of using AI to build task-specific conversational agents."
